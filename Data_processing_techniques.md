# Data processing techniques

## 1. **Seasonal decomposition**

The principle of seasonal decomposition is to separate a time series into its different components, namely trend, seasonality, and residual (or irregular), in order to better understand and analyze the underlying patterns and variations.

- **Trend**

​		It captures the overall upward or downward movement of the time series over an extended 		period.

- **Seasonality**

  The seasonal component captures the repetitive patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals within the data.

- **Residual**

​		The residual component, also known as the irregular or noise component. It represents the 		unexplained or residual variation that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.
